# Captains-Log

A place to write your Captain's Log in The Terminal. Directly Inspired By Star Trek

This is a note taking TUI program.
# WIP

!! This is a work in progress and still in the smoothing stage !!

Currently the project is usable but may have various bugs.

I feel that the project is in a state that is acceptable to me.

Feel free to mess around!

## Details

#### MOTD name variable
For custom the MOTD message, use {captain_name} to have your name placed in the MOTD.

#### Config and storage location
config.json will be created after the first boot, these settings can be changed in storage/config.json.
I recommend using the built in settings menu though to change these.

storage/logs/ will be created on first boot even if a custom logs storage location is selected.

#### About
- "Computer" is a Prototype computer that was made during the construction of the Enterprise NX-01!
- It's a bit slow... and can only record Captains logs... via text. But! Don't leave ol Computer here all alone!
- Sit down and write up some logs, even make a custom MOTD to inspire yourself!
- Locally stored terminal fun with a prototype Star Trek computer!

## What is this not?

- This is NOT a proper text editor, it uses other text editors to function.

- This is NOT a full fledged note keeping program.

- This is NOT a good way to store important notes and information(debated).

## What is this?

- A fun Star Trek inspired project.

- A SIMULATION of an AI from Star Trek, not any sort of LLM.

- A fun way to "Become" somewhat of a Star Trek Captain.

- A project to help me grow as a programmer.

## The Future

As of when this readme had its last commit, I want to build and improve on this project.

I plan to add more features to it on the "Star Trek" computer side.

But as a "Note Taking" program, it will always be pretty basic, I think. Like, it will always use an external editor, unless I get the drive to try and make my own haha.
