# Captains-Log
A place to write your Captains Log In The Terminal. Directly Inspired By StarTrek

# Details
"Computer" is a Prototype computer that was made during the construction of the Enterprise NX-01!

It's a bit slow... and can only record Captains logs... via text. But! Don't leave ol Computer here all alone!

Sit down and write up some logs, even make a custom MOTD to inspire yourself!

Locally stored terminal fun with a prototype Star Trek computer!
