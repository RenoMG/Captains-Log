# Captains-Log
A place to write your Captains Log In The Terminal. Directly Inspired By StarTrek

## Details
"Computer" is a Prototype computer that was made during the construction of the Enterprise NX-01!

It's a bit slow... and can only record Captains logs... via text. But! Don't leave ol Computer here all alone!

Sit down and write up some logs, even make a custom MOTD to inspire yourself!

Locally stored terminal fun with a prototype Star Trek computer!

## What is this not?
- This is NOT a proper text editor
- This is NOT a full fledged note keeping program
- This is NOT a good way to store important notes and information

## What is this?
- A fun Star Trek inspired project
- A SIMULATION of an AI from Star Trek, not any sort of LLM
- A fun way to "Become" somewhat of a Star Trek Captain 
- A project to help me grow as a programmer

## The Future
As of when this readme had it's last commit, I want to build and improve on this project.

I plan to add more featured to it on the "Star Trek" computer side.

But as a "Note Taking" program, it will always be pretty basic I think.
